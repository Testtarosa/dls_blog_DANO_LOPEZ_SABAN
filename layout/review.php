                <h3>Almira Años</h3>
                <p>We had the most remarkable family tour with DNS travel. Not only everything was perfect, but we felt, in every instance, that our guides and our gulet crew truly cared about us, both the kids and adults, and did their best to make this trip memorable. We definitely will be back!</p>

                <h3>Khier Dano</h3>
                <p>This was our fourth trip with my beloved Almira Años and it lived up to our very high expectations. It was a wonderfully organized trip with beautiful cruising and swimming spots, great hikes, and fascinating lectures on the region and history. The ship was beautiful, comfortable, and excellently crewed. The guide was wonderfully informed and participated enthusiastically in all the activities. A shout-out also to the local guides who each brought their own perspective. Excellent.</p>

                <h3>Jacquilyn Saban</h3>
                <p>This was our second PST tour (first one was to Crete). Both tours have been excellent. PST tour leaders are not only experts in their academic fields but are also masters at making the tours work smoothly and efficiently. The itineraries are excellent, both in terms of venues and in terms of the pace of the tour. The choices of accommodations and the dining locales never disappoint. My wife and I have done many tours with a variety of tour companies. PST is definitely the best.</p>

                <h3>Ako lang to</h3>
                <p>his was a superb tour... beautifully crafted, taking us through the long history of the island and travelling from the arid East to the green West. The accommodation was wonderful and the food/wine experiences truly memorable. Heinrich is not only a fount of knowledge but a wonderful host and has a great sense of humour. Heinrich and Vangelis (the local guide) both went to great lengths to provide us with experiences much beyond expectations and I cannot thank them enough.</p>
